#### About me
***  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I have a main job that is not entirely related to software development. But there was always a desire to learn new things, as well as a desire to program and solve interesting problems. That is the main reason why I've decided to try something new (rs school). I hope my diligence and the courses will help me to obtain useful knowledge.
#### Skills:
***
Java
HTML&CSS
Git
Docker
#### Code Example
***
``` java
public class StudentIdException extends  IllegalArgumentException {
    private final static String EX_HEAD = "Could not find student with ID {";
    private final static String EX_TAIL = "}";
    private long id;

    public StudentIdException(long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public StudentIdException(String message, Throwable cause) {
        super(message, cause);
    }

    @Override
    public String getMessage() {
        return EX_HEAD + id;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return EX_HEAD + id + EX_TAIL;
    }
